## Abstract

D3 is well-known as an SVG visualization library, but can provide a powerful platform for building entire front-end applications.

As Bret Victor's essay "Magic Ink" points out, most of [software is visualization](http://worrydream.com/MagicInk/#most_software_is_information_software) â€”
by imagining your interface as an interactive chart, building an entire app with with a DOM-based visualization library starts to make sense!
Well-crafted code using D3 looks declarative, can be debugged imperatively, and lets you efficiently react to asynchronous or realtime updates.
We'll look at how D3 combines what *is* right about jQuery with architectural sanity like Knockout/Angular/Ember devs get.

This talk will defend using D3 for everything, show how to do it well, and explain what sort of architecture(s) can result.
