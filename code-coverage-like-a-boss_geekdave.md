#Code Coverage (Like a Boss)

##Abstract

Code Coverage tools can prove to be invaluable resources in software projects large and small.  But just like putting a hammer in your toolbox won't build you a safer house, Code Coverage tools will do little for you on their own, without a process to follow.

In this talk, you'll learn:

* how implementing a Code Coverage process keeps teams honest and avoids technical debt.  
* how to automate the coverage enforcement process using Grunt, so that you don't have to nag your teammates.  
* how coverage statistics can lie to you, and what you can do about it.  
* why chasing a high coverage percentage is a bad strategy, and how to explain that to your number-oriented boss.  
* why "Feature Coverage" is an essential companion to Code Coverage
* how your QA team can get involved with the Unit Testing process without writing any code.

Dave works from the mountains of Colorado as the lead UI Architect for Model N, Inc.
