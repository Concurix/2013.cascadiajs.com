## Abstract

Let's close our eyes, hold hands, & imagine together. Sit here, cross legged, open minded.
We're going to fantasy land.

Welcome friend. Here, all code across languages utilizes a few well known mathematical interfaces.
Knowledge gained stays relevant. Here you can instantly swap 1 module for another,
compose everything, avoid docs, share algorithms, effortlessly optimize, discuss things in common terms!

"Bullhonkey", you proclaim as I start to hum a low note quietly.
"Shhhhhhh...", I press my finger to your lips. "Come to my talk & I'll explain everything..."
                                                               
We'll look at the FP ecosystem to see what how they are doing this _right now_.
You'll hear why normal folks like you & me get bit by the math bug.
We'll see all of this in understandable JS. We'll have our utopia and eat it too.
