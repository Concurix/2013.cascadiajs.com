# JavaScript as a First-Class Citizen on iOS 7

### Abstract
For mobile and JavaScript developers, one of the most exciting technology
announcements to come out of WWDC in 2013 was built-in binding support for 
JavaScript to Objective-C without the use of a third party framework or plugin.  
This allows developers full access to iOS 7 (and OS X Mavericks) frameworks from 
JavaScript programs.

In this talk, we'll focus on what JavaScript developers need to know to take
advantage of this new technology in iOS 7 (though the same principles will
apply for JavaScript development on Mavericks).  To demonstrate these binding
capabilities, we will script a simple 2D game using SpriteKit, the new 2D
game framework also announced at WWDC.  There are many exciting possible
applications of this technology, and I hope the JavaScript community takes
full advantage of them.
